### Deployment Scripts

- `deploy-check.sh` - Pre-deployment validation script
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide

### Production Optimizations

- Updated `main.ts` with Railway-specific configurations
- Enhanced health check endpoint with deployment info
- Production logging configuration
- CORS setup for Railway domains

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Set environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   USE_AI_PARAPHRASE=false
   USE_ADVANCED_PARAPHRASE=true
   ```
5. Deploy!

### 3. Test Deployment

Once deployed, test your endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/paraphrase/health

# API test
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/paraphrase \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world", "style": "simple"}'
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Details

### Environment Variables (Set in Railway Dashboard)

```env
NODE_ENV=production
USE_AI_PARAPHRASE=false          # Disable AI for basic deployment
USE_ADVANCED_PARAPHRASE=true     # Use advanced strategy
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=your-frontend.com # Optional: CORS domains
```

### Railway Automatic Variables

Railway will automatically provide:

- `PORT` - The port to listen on
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` - Your app's public domain

## ðŸ“Š Health Check Response

After deployment, your health check will show:

```json
{
